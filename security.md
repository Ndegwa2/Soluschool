# Qreet Platform - Security & Compliance Considerations

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Password hashing using bcrypt/scrypt
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism
- Secure token storage in localStorage (with httpOnly cookies for production)

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC):
  - **Parent**: Manage own children/QR codes, view notifications
  - **Guard**: Scan QR codes, view limited logs
  - **Admin**: Full system access, manage schools/users
- Endpoint-level permission checks
- User session management with automatic logout

## Data Security

### Encryption
- **At Rest**: SQLite database encryption using SQLCipher
- **In Transit**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Sensitive Data**: Phone numbers, QR data encrypted before storage

### QR Code Security
- Unique, cryptographically secure QR generation
- QR data includes timestamp and nonce for replay prevention
- Automatic expiration for guest QR codes
- Immediate revocation capability
- QR validation against active codes only

## Compliance

### Privacy Regulations
- GDPR/CCPA compliance for EU/US users
- Data minimization: Only collect necessary information
- User consent for data processing
- Right to data deletion and portability
- Privacy policy and terms of service

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 mitigation
- Secure coding practices
- Regular security audits
- Incident response plan

## Application Security

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all API inputs
- Sanitization of user inputs
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection in frontend

### Rate Limiting
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Brute force protection on authentication endpoints
- DDoS protection via hosting provider

### Logging & Monitoring
- Comprehensive audit logs for all security events
- Log aggregation and monitoring
- Alert system for suspicious activities
- Immutable logs for compliance

## Offline Security

### Cached Data Protection
- Encrypted local storage for offline QR cache
- Automatic cache invalidation on sync
- No sensitive data stored in browser cache
- Secure wipe on logout

### SMS Fallback Security
- SMS commands require child ID verification
- Rate limiting on SMS endpoints
- Temporary access codes with short expiration

## Operational Security

### Access Controls
- Principle of least privilege for all users
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts (future)
- Secure API keys for external services (SMS/Email)
- Environment variable management for secrets

### Incident Response
- Security incident reporting process
- Data breach notification procedures
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Regular security training for development team

## Third-Party Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Use of trusted libraries (Flask, Next.js, SQLite)
- Security audits of third-party services (SMS gateways)

## Future Enhancements
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Biometric authentication options
- Advanced threat detection
- Zero-trust architecture implementation
